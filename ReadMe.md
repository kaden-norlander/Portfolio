## 🧭 Overview

My portfolio is a professional one-page website designed to showcase my skills, projects, certifications, and contact information. It provides potential employers with a clear summary of who I am and what I can do, all while maintaining a sleek and responsive design.

## 🎯 Project Goals

Inspired by StackOverflow’s color scheme, I aimed to build a unique and accessible layout using scroll snapping and SVG icons. My goal was to make the information easy to navigate and visually appealing across all devices.
